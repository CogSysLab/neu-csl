  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Radar Automated Target Recognition (RATR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) involves transmitting Electromagnetic Waves (EMWs) and performing target type recognition on the received radar echo, which has important applications in defense and aerospace. Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of employing multistatic radar configurations in RATR compared to monostatic radar configurations. However, multistatic radar configurations commonly use fusion methods which combine the classification vectors of multiple individual radars suboptimally from a probabilistic perspective.
     To address this issue, this work leverages Bayesian analysis to provide a fully Bayesian RATR framework for UAV type classification. Specifically, we employ an Optimal Bayesian Fusion (OBF) method, from the Bayesian perspective of expected 0-1 loss, to formulate a posterior distribution that aggregates the classification probability vectors from multiple individual radar observations at a given time step. This OBF method is used to update a separate Recursive Bayesian Classification (RBC) posterior distribution on the target UAV type. The RBC posterior is conditioned on all historical observations made from multiple radars across multiple time steps.
    To evaluate the proposed approach, we simulate random walk trajectories for seven drones and correspond the target’s aspect angles to Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements acquired in an anechoic chamber. We then compare the performance of single radar Automated Target Recognition (ATR) system and suboptimal fusion methods against the OBF method. We empirically show that the OBF method, integrated with RBC, significantly outperforms other fusion methods and single radar configuration in terms of classification accuracy.

      abstract={Continuously optimizing sensor placement is essential for precise target localization in various military and civilian applications. While information theory has shown promise in optimizing sensor placement, many studies oversimplify sensor measurement models or neglect dynamic constraints of mobile sensors. To address these challenges, we employ a range measurement model that incorporates radar parameters and radar-target distance, coupled with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to manage complex environmental obstacles and dynamic constraints. We compare the proposed approach against stationary radars or simplified range measurement models based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) estimator for the targets' state. Additionally, we visualize the evolving geometry of radars and targets over time, highlighting areas of highest measurement information gain, demonstrating the strengths of the approach. The proposed strategy outperforms stationary radars and simplified range measurement models in target localization, achieving a 38-74% reduction in mean RMSE and a 33-79% reduction in the upper tail of the 90% Highest Density Interval (HDI) over 500 Monte Carl (MC) trials across all time steps.
Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.},
